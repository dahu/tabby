Help on using Tabby                                                    *tabby*


Tabby fixes the non-orthogonal behaviour of |gt| vs |gT|.

`gt` now moves forward [count] number of tabs (default 1)
(so,   `3gt`   moves forward 3 tabs)

|gT| retains its default behaviour of moving backward [count] tabs

A new `<leader>gt` map replaces the old |gt| behaviour of jumping to a tab by
number (so,   `3<leader>gt`   moves to tab 3)

`<leader>T` jumps to the alternate tab. This allows quick switching
between current tabs like |ctrl-6| switches between current buffers.
